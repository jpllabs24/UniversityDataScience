# This portfolio is used to display data analytics, data science, and machine learning projects from my undergraduate degree.
# Projects use a variety of different libraries from SQLite, Pandas, and Numpy for data analysis, to altair, seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization. 
# Other projects are more focused on machine learning using classification algorithms like perceptron, KNN, and logistic regression.
